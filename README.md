# hardware_interfacing

### Description
This repo contains all six parts of the hardware interfacing project. Each map is named after the part it contains. 

>AssignmentThree

For each of the six assignments I will list the hardware needed to build the setup. The parts listed are the ones I used to run my code on. I won't list the fact that **each assignment uses one arduino board and one breadbord** since these amounts don't change. 
I'll also incluse links to the video containing a demonstration of the working hardware. Each video is placed the playlist for this assignment on my youtube. 

#### Assignment one
